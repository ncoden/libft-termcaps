#### Development
The development method used is the [Design by contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract) : a function requires some arguments, and provides in exchange for return a valid result.

It is **normal that the program crashes** if bad parameters are passed to a function. **It's the developer's job to ensure that he correctly uses the library**. Some functions still contain argument checks, but the new features should not.

#### Library

There is no description of all functions of the library. Maybe soon?
